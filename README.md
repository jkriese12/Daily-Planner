# Daily-Planner

Daily planner for a standard 9AM to 5PM work day. Each hourly row has a built in textarea for user to input scheduled items for the day. After hitting the save button it will save user input to local storage which will generate each time the page is reloaded so their input is not lost.

Each row will change color based on the time of day to indicate past, present or future. Grey for past, red for present and green for future.
